## I. Introduction
In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed the experiences of both students and educators. AI has become a widely used tool in the academic sphere, helping with studying, completing assignments, and even creating teaching guides. For software engineers, especially students like myself studying computer science, AI has been a useful resource. It can detect syntax errors, identify issues, revise function functionality, and even generate entire pieces of code. In my experience, various AI tools have been helpful for tasks like revising grammar. However, in software engineering, the only AI tool I’ve used is ChatGPT, designed to receive instructions and provide responses based on user input.

## II. Personal Experience with AI
- **Experience WODs:** In the course ICS 314 at UHM, which teaches software engineering, we had timed exams called Workouts of the Day (WODs) to test how well we understood the material for the week. To prepare for the WODS, we were given assignments to complete on our own time, known as experience WODs. For the assignment [E18: Experience Functional Programming (Part 1)](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f24/morea/typescript-3/experience-functional-programming-1.html), I could not finish within the time limit and had to watch the solution video provided. However, I was still struggling to understand a part of the solution. The assignment required writing a function that would return the percentage of degrees awarded to students of Hawaiian Legacy in the dataset. This function utilized the filter() method supported by the TypeScript language, and to better understand this method, I used ChatGPT. It efficiently taught how the filter() method works, explaining its parameters (a callback and an optional thisArg), and gave several examples.
- **In-Class Practice WODs:** Another way we prepared for the official WODs was by collaborating with classmates on practice WODs during class time. Unlike the experience WODS, these in-class practices did not include video solutions, so we heavily relied on our knowledge from the material we learned beforehand, help from classmates, or searching online. For the [In Class Practice WOD: Green Jobs](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f24/morea/typescript-3/inclass-greenjobs.html), we needed to write several functions using TypeScript methods. Like the experience WODs, I used ChatGPT to help me better understand the TypeScript methods. I asked, “What TypeScript method would return an array of strings containing all the industries (a key), and how does this method work?” ChatGPT was more efficient than Google because it provided a single solution rather than multiple. Since WODs were timed, this saved me time from verifying which solutions provided by Google were functional for the specific problem.
- **In-Class Official WODs:** For the official WODs, I used ChatGPT in the same way as I did for the practice WODs, asking which TypeScript method would be appropriate for specific tasks. Under the time pressure, I often blanked on which methods existed, so ChatGPT was a quick way to remind myself and figure out the solution. Later, when the course material shifted to React and Next.js, I stopped relying on ChatGPT for the official WODs. I found the experience WODs more helpful, especially since the video solutions for React and Next.js were clearer than the ones for TypeScript. The official WODs also became more similar to the experience WODs, making it much easier to reference them during the official WOD.
- **Essays:** Although ICS 314 is a software engineering course, we often had to write essays related to the course material. I have been using the AI tool Grammarly for as long as I can remember to help with any class that requires essays. It corrects grammar mistakes and offers suggestions for changing certain words to improve the tone. I also use ChatGPT when I struggle to form complete sentences. I often begin my writing process by jotting down incomplete thoughts to brainstorm ideas for my essay. ChatGPT helps me review these thoughts and provides suggestions to improve the clarity of my ideas.
- **Final Project:** For my project, I used ChatGPT to help create functionality we had not learned in class. My project was a platform that allowed users to post anonymous letters, where they could vent or share their thoughts and receive replies. A feature we wanted to include was the ability for users to sort through all the letters by clicking buttons to filter them by tags. I asked ChatGPT how to add filter buttons to this page. This gave me suggestions, and I could share my existing code and ask which solution would work best. While the suggestions were not always accurate in terms of implementation, I found them helpful as a starting point. From there, I would further research and experiment with my code to achieve the desired functionality.
- **Learning a Concept / Tutorial:** As previously mentioned, I used ChatGPT when I didn’t understand the video solutions provided by the instructor. I liked using ChatGPT as I could ask more specific questions based on the examples it provided me. However, when I needed more detailed explanations, I turned to articles and YouTube videos. These resources provided more step-by-step tutorials on concepts. For instance, learning how to use pgAdmin and connect to a database became much clearer through watching tutorials.
- **Answering Questions:** When answering questions, I did not use any AI tools. I believed the best answers would come from my own words, reflecting my knowledge. Additionally, I felt that when my classmates asked questions, they were looking for answers that weren’t generated by AI. In this scenario, AI seemed unnecessary, as providing answers was most helpful if I faced the same problem and had already come up with a solution or answer I could share.
- **Asking / Answering Smart-Questions:** One of the essays we wrote in this course was about “smart-questions.” We learned how to create smart-questions by trying to find a solution before asking, clearly explaining the issue, and specifying what we had already tried. I did not use any AI tools when asking smart-questions because I understood my issue best and could clearly explain all the relevant factors to frame my question as a smart one, rather than relying on an AI tool to do so. I also did not provide any answers in the “smart-questions” channel in the course’s Discord server, as I found the answers already posted to be useful.
- **Coding Example:** As mentioned earlier regarding my experience with WODs, I used ChatGPT to provide coding examples. For example, when I was learning about the .filter() method in TypeScript, I asked for clarification on the parameters it required and requested examples. I continued this approach for other assignments and my project, asking questions like, “Give me an example of [blank],” where the blank referred to various methods, implementations of a collapse feature for the navigation bar, filter buttons, etc.
- **Explaining Code:** At times, when ChatGPT provided solutions, such as the implementation of filter buttons in my final project, I felt I needed more detailed explanations of how the solution worked. However, the explanations were often too lengthy and didn’t break down what each line of code was doing.
- **Writing Code:** When I needed to implement functionality in my code, I found ChatGPT helpful in writing code for me. As I mentioned earlier, for my project, I would ask how to implement a function, then share my code, and ChatGPT would offer the best solution. For my final project, I also needed to get the user’s letters and display them on the profile page. ChatGPT helped give solution suggestions after I shared my implementation attempts.
- **Documenting Code:** When I used ChatGPT to explain code, I previously mentioned that I found the explanations lengthy. I found it more helpful to ask ChatGPT to “Provide comments above each line, explaining what each line of code does.” This approach made it clearer to me how the chunks of example code functioned.
- **Quality Assurance:** Throughout the semester, when I attempted to find solutions on my own and encountered errors, I would ask, “Why doesn’t the functionality of this code work?” When the course focused on TypeScript, we used TypeScript Playground, an online editor. Unlike Visual Studio Code, it doesn’t support extensions, so I relied on ChatGPT to help resolve issues on TypeScript Playground. Later, when we switched to Visual Studio Code, we began receiving ESLint errors. However, I didn’t need to use ChatGPT to fix these errors, as I could rely on the Prettier ESLint Extension to easily resolve them in the application.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
Using AI tools in this course was helpful in many situations, but there were instances when I felt that using AI tools was unnecessary. If AI tools had been prohibited in this course, I believe it would have limited my ability to learn and fully understand the material. From my personal experience, I stated that using Google to search for solutions was often tedious, as it provided multiple answers and suggestions that I had to go through. While ChatGPT and other AI tools don’t always give the correct solution, they reduce the time spent on research, allowing me to focus more on understanding the solution.

## IV. Practical Applications
AI tools have numerous practical applications outside of ICS 314, even in real-world software engineering. AI technology relies on machine learning techniques, enabling systems to learn from large datasets and continually improve their performance. This makes resolving challenges with AI not only more efficient for students but also for software engineers. In the real world, software engineers use AI to solve problems and enhance technology for people around the world. Consider the iPhone’s facial recognition feature, which uses AI algorithms to analyze an individual’s unique facial features to unlock their phone. While AI may not always provide perfect solutions, it reduces the time spent on implementing effective solutions.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities
One of the challenges of using AI in this course was that relying on AI can lead to the temptation to copy solutions instead of fully engaging with the material. There were times when I had to pause and remind myself that it would be more beneficial to seek other resources first, as this would enhance my understanding of the content. Another challenge was using my judgment to evaluate whether the answers provided by AI were the most suitable for the situation. However, I see great potential in further integrating AI into software engineering education. Through machine learning, AI can learn from large datasets, including student interactions. This data could then help identify effective teaching methods, which could be applied to improve and personalize education for students more efficiently.

## VI. Future Considerations
Traditional teaching methods and AI-enhanced approaches each offer distinct advantages for software engineering education. AI tools help provide immediate feedback, allowing students to get immediate feedback when checking if their solutions are correct. This immediacy helps maintain student engagement and prevent the boredom that arises in traditional lecture settings. On the other hand, traditional teaching methods emphasize peer interaction and collaboration, which foster deeper learning and enhance knowledge retention through discussion. While traditional teaching encourages critical thinking and problem-solving, AI approaches may not always promote the same level of analysis. Combining both AI and traditional methods could create a more balanced approach, addressing the strengths and weaknesses of each to enhance student learning in software engineering.

## VII. Challenges and Opportunities
The role of AI in software engineering education is likely to become more prominent in the future, with more students using these tools to assist with learning and completing tasks. While some educators may limit the use of AI, I believe there will come a time when preventing its use will no longer be possible. Embracing the role of AI is crucial, and I hope these tools become more personalized for each user. Ideally, AI should learn the best learning techniques for individual students and provide tailored solutions. With these improvements, students will have a better understanding of the material and be able to create more effectively.

## VIII. Conclusion
Reflecting on the use of AI in this software engineering course, I realize that it significantly shaped my learning experience. It provided me with opportunities to effectively grasp the material my instructor aimed to teach and even enabled me to implement features in my final project that were not explicitly covered in the course. However, both myself and other students need to be mindful of how heavily we rely on these AI tools. Finding a balance between using AI to enhance learning and maintaining independent problem-solving skills is essential. For future courses, I would recommend that instructors actively remind students of their capabilities and encourage them to attempt solutions independently before turning to AI tools.
