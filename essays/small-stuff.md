Coding standards refer to the guidelines that software engineers follow to ensure readability, maintainability, efficiency, reliability, and reusability in their programs. While some of these guidelines may seem tedious, like adding a space after a comma between function arguments, they are purposeful and beneficial. Adhering to these standards can also feel frustrating, especially when one feels lazy or rushed. However, even though coding standards are not necessary for a program to function, I believe they are valuable for maintaining code quality. These standards require attention to detail and improve understanding of certain coding practices. For instance, naming conventions make code clearer for both the programmer and others who read it. Additionally, when everyone follows the same structure, it becomes easier for programmers to collaborate and learn from each other. Having a collective agreement on coding habits fosters better teamwork and allows for more focus on creating a functional program.

The ESLint extension for VSCode helps reinforce coding standards. Initially, I found the ESLint errors annoying because they kept interrupting my workflow. I wanted to focus on my program’s functionality, so it frustrated me when errors appeared just because I wasn’t following coding standards. However, I soon realized the importance of these standards when I considered how other programmers might view my code. Whether someone is implementing similar functionalities in their own code or collaborating on the same project, coding standards make it easier to understand my work. They reduce confusion and allow everyone to focus on functionality. Since programmers often need to review each other’s code, ESLint is a valuable tool for maintaining consistent coding practices.
