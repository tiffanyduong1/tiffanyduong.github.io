## Personal Interest: The Joy of Front-End Development

Software engineering encompasses a variety of roles, including development, testing, and maintenance of software. Within this broad field, I have a strong interest in the design and development of website applications. The aspect of front-end development brings me great enjoyment, as it allows me to create interfaces that users interact with directly. There is immense satisfaction in knowing that the work I put into a project is not only functional but also visually appealing and easy for users to navigate.

## Hopes for Myself: Diving into UI Design

My interest in developing website applications also drives my desire to dive into user interface (UI) design. Although my current knowledge of visual design is limited, I am eager to learn more. I believe that learning more about UI design will be effective in creating exceptional user experiences (UX). By mastering UI design, I will be able to attract more users to the web applications I build in the future. This will allow me to create interfaces that not only look appealing but also make it easy for users to navigate and enjoy.

## Hopes for Myself: Addressing Real-World Problems

Another skill I would like to develop is the ability to identify real-world problems and data and apply them to programming. My current experience has been confined to the classroom, where I have primarily focused on structured assignments and projects given by my professors. While this has helped me learn various programming languages, I have yet to apply this knowledge to real-life situations. In the coming years, I aim to work on projects that address and solve complex, real-world issues, benefiting not only myself but also others.
