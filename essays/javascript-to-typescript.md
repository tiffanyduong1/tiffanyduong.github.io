TypeScript is a programming language built upon JavaScript, offering enhancements that allow programmers to accomplish more than they can with JavaScript alone. In my ICS 314: Software Engineering course, I encountered TypeScript for the first time and found it straightforward to grasp. My familiarity with JavaScrip likely made the process of learning TypeScript feel almost like a review, so it was fairly quick to learn as well.

I find TypeScript’s object-oriented features and support for interfaces to be enjoyable aspects, as they offer programmers more range and flexibility in their code. When familiar with other programming languages as well, it can be easy to forget which languages support certain syntax. The variety of syntax options in TypeScript is a notable and valuable feature to accommodate this. Additionally, through the course, I also learned about ES6, an extension of JavaScript. It was interesting to explore arrow functions, template literals, rest parameters, and other unique features of ES6. While I might not use syntax like arrow functions frequently due to my familiarity with other programming languages, I can see how efficient ES6 syntax can be for others. Having various ways of writing certain code allows programmers to choose what is easiest for them to understand and use.

Athletic engineering refers to an activity done in the course, where students complete coding problems within a set time frame. This creates urgency, encourages students to “lock in,” and finish writing their program before the timer runs out. These activities, known as WODs (Workouts of the Day), included practice through homework. At home, students were tasked with solving coding problems and learning skills from practicing. During class, students are not only under the pressure of the time but also ensuring their code works as expected, as points are awarded as either 0 or 100. I found this learning approach to be stressful but very effective, as it forced me to practice coding at home. Often, I lack motivation to practice on my own, but knowing my grade depended on being both fast and correct drove me to practice every day. Although I anticipate struggles and frustration with possibly failing WODs, I believe that athletic engineering will be an effective approach for me.
