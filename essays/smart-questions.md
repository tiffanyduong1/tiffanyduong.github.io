Have you ever received an answer to a question that was useless? Have you considered that it might have been because your question was not clear enough? Asking smart questions as a software engineer is essential to receiving proper guidance. To ask a smart question, begin by researching your problem. This might help you find a solution that already exists or at least help you gain a better understanding of the issue. If your attempts through research do not resolve the problem, be thoughtful when creating your question. Take the time to clearly explain your issue, being detailed yet concise, and using proper grammar. Describe the symptoms and list the steps you have taken to solve the problem in chronological order. Remember to include the programming language and other relevant details that might help the reader assist you. Consider the platform where you are asking your question. Use a specific subject line, rather than something vague like “Help me.” Lastly, always be polite, even if you do not get an answer.

## Example of a “Not Smart” Question

Let’s look at a question that is not written in a smart way. The subject line is, “How do I fix this stack overflow error in my code below?” While the subject is concise, it lacks specificity. In the body of the forum post, the user fails to explain what type of stack overflow error they are receiving. They simply mention that they have an error while trying to write a program to calculate the square of a number and then paste their entire code. There are no additional details on what they have tried to do to resolve the issue. This gives the impression that they want someone to solve the problem for them without making much effort to learn and resolve it on their own. This lack of detail and effort makes the question not smart.

## Example of a “Smart” Question

Now let’s compare this to a smarter question. The subject line is, “How to convert this ‘string’ to a correct date?” Although the subject could be more specific, it still provides the reader with a clear idea of what the user is struggling with. In the body of the question, the user clearly states they are working in JavaScript and explains how the date is retrieved from a PostgreSQL database via Python. They specify the format of the date that is outputted and the format they want instead. The user explains what they believe is causing their output to be in the incorrect format. They also seem to expect guidance rather than a complete solution, demonstrating a willingness to participate in solving the problem by asking what method they could use to help convert their output to the expected format. However, while this is a strong example, the question could be improved by being clearer that they are facing two issues: the incorrect date format, and the fact that the date is displaying a day earlier than expected. If this were clearer, it would be an excellent example of a smart question.

## Why Smart Questions Matter

Asking a smart question shows others the effort you have made to solve the problem on your own before seeking help, making them more inclined to assist. Smart questions also tend to lead to more effective and useful responses because others are given specific information to properly engage with the problem. The answers to smart questions will likely be clear and concise, just as the question itself should be. By using the steps to create a smart question, you are more likely to receive helpful results. If you ever find yourself wondering why no one has replied to your question, consider the steps to create a smart question and try asking again. You will likely see better results in both getting help and learning more.
